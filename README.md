Practice Producing Games with Python

This repository will follow my journey through the exercises provided in the book by Al Sweigart
(https://inventwithpython.com/makinggames.pdf) using python to produce some basic games.

These exercises are being performed using Python 2.7.12 and the pygame-1.9.2b6 package on OSX El Capitan
